# NOG-NLG
Implementation of NOG-NLG layer from Cezanne-ai framework

Adaptation for restaurant recommendation and deep-conversational based on 3 books. The architecture can be used independent of the language, but for other domains some sub-layers/pipelines needs to be adapted.

The final form of this model will be committed in new repository together with the other layers: CPL, NIU/NLU and back-up model

Code implementation in progress. 
Possible commit date: 31 December 2021.

Please check for details: Project-documentation repository (Cezanne-ai project) and the research paper "Cezanne-ai: a conversational AI open-framework for multi-domains, all the languages and limited data".
